JW's Opinionated Meteor Skeleton
============

_Compatible with 0.7.0.1 of the [Meteor/nodejs](http://meteor.com) web development framework._

Thanks to [Roland Flanagan](https://github.com/flanamacca) for contributions as well!


A collection of packages and a good starting point for building my next meteor project.

You may also find it useful. ;) But I wrote this for me, I love Coffeescript, and you may not, so feel free to change this to use whatever languages and packages you want.

##Strucutre
I based most of the structure off of the wonderful [Unofficial Meteor FAQ](https://github.com/oortcloud/unofficial-meteor-faq) with a few changes such as I chose `main.html` instead of `index.html` as `main.*` is loaded last.
I also tried to incorporate any configuration settings, events, options, of each of the packages into the codebase for easy editing.

##Packages included in my Meteor skeleton:

* [autoform](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/autoform) - adds handlebars helpers to easily create basic forms with automatic insert and update events, and automatic reactive validation.
* [bootboxjs](https://github.com/TimHeckel/meteor-bootboxjs) - small JavaScript library which allows you to create programmatic dialog boxes using Twitterâ€™s Bootstrap modals, without having to worry about creating, managing or removing any of the required DOM elements or JS event handlers
* [bootstrap-themes](https://github.com/eprochasson/meteor-bootstrap-themes) - Twitter's Bootstrap+Themes Packaged for Meteor, using Less
* [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) - little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
* [collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) - extends Meteor.Collection to provide support for specifying a schema and then validating against that schema when inserting and updating. Also adds support for virtual fields.
* [event-hooks](https://github.com/BenjaminRH/meteor-event-hooks) - Provides hooks for various user-triggered events.
* [headers](https://github.com/gadicohen/meteor-headers) - Access HTTP headers on both server and client.
* [iron-router](https://github.com/EventedMind/meteor-iron-router) - A reactive, highly customizable router that is Meteor specific -- it knows about your subscriptions, data sources and helps you take care of common problems.
* [less](http://lesscss.org) - extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.
* [managedUsers](https://github.com/jzgoda/managedUsers) - simple package for making Meteor's default Accounts system more managed. With it, you will get: A single "admin" account (default password is "abc123"...obviously change this). A permissions system, which by default has no permissions (so, it's optional). Templates for adding, updating, and deleting user accounts.
* [moment-alternative](https://github.com/acreeger/meteor-moment) - Moment.js, a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates, packaged for Meteor. An alternative version because the original hasn't been maintained for a while. See http://momentjs.com.
* [npm](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-npm) - Complete NPM integration for Meteor
* [observatory](http://observatoryjs.com) - Observatory makes your Meteor application development a breeze by providing easy logging API, key application internals monitoring and visual integrated test framework all nicely presented right in the browser.
* [profile-online](https://github.com/erundook/meteor-profile-online) - provides a convenient way to expose accounts online status. Sign in to your application and you will get your profile.online field set to true. Log out, and it goes false.
* [roles](https://github.com/alanning/meteor-roles) - Roles-based authorization package for Meteor - compatible with built-in accounts package.


If you want to make this what is generated when you run `meteor create` then just replace the contents of `~/.meteor/tools/latest/tools/skel/` with my codebase.

I welcome all feedback and look forward to seeing everyone's versions of their own skeltons.
Please use the github ticketing system as opposed to emailing me directly.

Often I am on freenode as osirisx11.

I release my codebase (or the portions that I own the license to, as obviously much of this is owned by others) into the public domain.


## Known bugs
* I can't seem to get the iron-router's notFoundTemplate to work.
* Publishing while autopublishing stanza on startup - I think one of the packages is publishing something. I might want to remove autopublish entirely as I end up usually doing that anyway, and encourage everyone to just start off with publishing.
